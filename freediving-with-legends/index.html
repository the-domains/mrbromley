It's also one of the few places to get a decent wifi signal and as I finish another run and coke I hit the call on Skype the number takes a few seconds to connect when a screeching on the line disturbs the natural calm that had descended on the dock since the sun slipped away a few hours ago. An instantly recognisable voice finally comes through over some dying digital static, 'where you are?' this slightly commanding yet overtly friendly Spanglish is the first I've heard from Carlos in two days, he reassures me that the choice of restaurant was well made and congratulates me on my arrival to the island, with little small talk we arrange to meet at 3 o'clock the following day. Enough time to settle in to my new home and get prepared, after all it's not every day I arrange to meet a world record holder and champion athlete.  </p><p>Carlos Coste is a Venezuelan national and holds a dozen records of mixed disciple in the small yet growing sport of Freediving. We're meeting on the small island of Bonaire whilst only 35 miles of the coast of his motherland this and a handful of neighbouring island are part of the Netherland Antilles, a microcosm of Dutch nationals, caribbean locals, Chinese immigrants and a steady mix of North American and European tourists. </p><p>Freediving is growing fast and the Bonaire already caters to regular Scuba divers like no other place I've been to. Almost every other shop is connected to the industry and with good reason, the surrounding waters and natural reefs and some 200 miles of coastline are entirely protected by UNESCO world heritage status. The preservation of the underwater world have been a big draw for dive tourism to the island and it also happens to be a near perfect location for Carlos' chosen passion. </p><p>Freediving requires, at least for some aspects, great depth at least 20-30+ meters for basic training. While most idolised caribbean Islands watch the sandy beaches drift out for miles Bonaire's marine topography offers 30m+ just a stones through from the main boulevard. </p><p>Being an experience dive gives you some confidence in and around the water but it does little to prepare you for Freediving which truly puts you in the category of athlete as apples to Sunday afternoon stroller as is often wonder while I love scuba it's incredibly passive and I have a hard time justifying it as a sport, more hobby to pass time. Freediving as Carlos's has exalted I've the phone many time give you much more of a connection to the ocean and pots you against your self as you start to develop you skills and challenge your mind and body toe relax and puss on to achieve your personal best. </p><p>We meet after lunch in his small office off the boulevard packed with gear and record attempt keepsakes it also doubles as the classroom for training a new breed of freediver. carlos's teaching takes the recognised standards and combines them with some 20 years of knowledge and training to create hybrid courses that not only improve diving safety and technique but also heavily focus on diet, health and fitness. Freediving I very much a lifestyle choice as much as it is a sport and for world class attempts like the one Carlos plans to break in six weeks time this mix is taken very seriously. </p><p>Our first land based session covers the history and basic theory behind the sport. Based on modern techniques developed over the last 20 years the fundamental concepts date back thousands of years and references appear in early philosophical literature with more widely known practices found in seafaring Asian communities of pearl divers and and fishermen the modern inception of free diving covers the recreational sport, spear fishing and competitive events. </p><p>While much of the theory has some cross over to the world of scuba the main principle is completely at odds. Freediving courses focus the Mind and body in preparation to dive as deep as possible using a single breath, and the physiological effects of entering such a seemingly unnatural environment have to be taken into account, the deeper you dive the more impact the pressure of the oceans negative atmosphere has on both internal organs such as the lungs and airspace and the more complex the mental barrier becomes to overcome your need to breath. Despite these factors Carlos ensures that the potential for even novices to the sport can reach 20-30m with his training.</p><picture>

<p>The next day training moves to the 'pool' which is actually the shallows of the nearby caribbean Ocean where he has set up training lines and markers to help develop underwater skills in calm crystal clear warm water. As we hear up (mask, snorkel and fins, check!) he delves deeper into his choice of island from the perfect year round warm but not stifling weather to the consistent currents and winds in the sheltered bays and amenities of both safety in the form of hyperbaric chamber (a must with so many divers around) and convince with fantastic restaurants and coffee shops and European standard supermarkets the whole package makes Bonaire a true Gem. Not to mention the ease of access from North and South America and direct connections to Europe. He believes in paradise and he's found his spiritual home.</p></div></section></div><section id="2" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-white colors-local " data-reactid="14"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="15"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="16"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="17"><span data-reactid="18"><!-- react-empty: 19 --><h2 data-reactid="20"><a data-reactid="21">mrbromley</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="22"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="23"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="24"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="25"></div></section></div></div>
