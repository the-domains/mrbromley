### London to Beijing on the Trans-Mongolian Railway

The strange thing about going half way round the world on a train is that in the immediate future you are not really going anywhere.

The moment passed without a tweet or update, after two years of waiting for this departure it was pleasant to simply enjoy it for myself.

Leaving recognizable station names behind and the mist rising over the green field lent itself nicely to the dramatic departure I had spent so much time constructing in my mind.

Quiet commuters filled the carriage as it takes our tender first few hours east.

In any trip there are always 'travel days' full of lost sleep, awkward body positions and poor diet, yet choosing to take a mode of transport for far greater than you normally would when it is mealy acting as a connection induces a sense contentment with your choice.

As a matter of perspective; 'having to catch the train' to a national Hub city then transferring to what is more commonly framed as a preferable way to travel long distances and finally arriving at previously dreamt of far long destination. Whereas consciously boarding a train as a longterm form of travel helps to rearrange the First world hardships that most commuters are forced to endure.

It would seem that very few are able to enjoy the journey for what it is, remaining trapped facing the wrong direction when they specifically booked facing seats or enduring the confabulation of double booked seats, let alone the inconvenience walking the length of the train in order to claim your upgraded First class seats. Oh the discomfort! All tales to be told over cups of tea in faraway front rooms or quick cigarette breaks outside fire doors, after the taxis and tubes.

Lack of excessive movement and awkward body contortion combine to induce temporarily crippled body parts. The hilarity of waiting for the effects to wear off like a cheap legal high are sure to wear thin within a few days, possibly even hours.

Fleeting glimpses of the quaint English countryside and cross sections of the many waterways that traverse the south coast of England and before to long we are shunting into London Town now a fully fledged mode of local transport for the hundreds who have boarded since we left the sleepy seaside villages in Cornwall some five and a half hour past.

The Eurostar still retains an air of elegant travel, the rails are as smooth as you might find on the continent and the service is refined and actually 'service'. The brisk jaunt through the remaining stretch of Southerly countryside is interspersed with less seen docklands of greater London. Occasional bouts of darkness prepare those onboard for the inevitable plunge beneath the channel.

With little acknowledgement that borders have been crossed the the only signs of geographical transfer are the small farms scattered in the rural French landscape. Distinct in their form from their neighbors only Twenty minutes train ride away.

Brussels arrives all to quickly and a short transfer to the local Thalys network proves to be as efficient as planned all those weeks ago. First class European trains feel like a different world and provide much needed comfort considering the length of this first leg to Moscow via Cologne and the next day Warsaw.

The afternoon sun drenched Cologne's imposing cathedral in gorgeous photographic light and the Two hour connection for the night train passes all to quickly in a tourist daze. Buttresses, naves and the merits of retaining the years of soot like weathering all rank highly amongst the comments on architectural features of such a disproportionate building.

The unapologetically named Euro-night functions as described and provides comfortable sleeping quarters for the evening allowing one to arrive in the Polish capitol somewhat revived after a vigorous first day on the rails.

Warsaw revived memories of another long haul trip some 3 years ago almost to the day when passing through by camper van for equally as short a stop and as the skies darkened de jevu set in with thoughts of getting soaked in the city before moving on further North. The weather held and the well trodden old town provided well with plate sized rations of wiener schtznell.

The night train to Moscow leaves Warsaw central station in the afternoon allowing for unhindered views of the changing scenery and finally the trip begins to take on it's own meaning as we head for the Belarus border. Two hours of stationary window gazing is rewarded with a perfect sunset at Terespol the Polish checkpoint. Dusk has fallen by the time the train continues East and freshly stamped visas, worth as much as a fine restaurant meal, allows only enough time in transit for moonlight glimpses of this overly private nation.

Despite Two fairly restful nights on the sleeper trains through to Moscow the sight of a real mattress induced an artificially early nights sleep, even if the accommodation was not the most charming of residences. If Basil Faulty had been night manager at a 24 hour storage facility and decorated it from the first few pages of an Ikea catalogue it would not have been too dissimilar.

Located in Central Moscow on the main walking street our humble abode had the advantage of being only Ten minutes walk from the Kremlin and St.Basils cathedral, both equally as impressive in their own right yet it is the cathedral that draws you back to the red square again and again. To see it at dusk and again under darkness and once more in the morning light. And possibly the only icon in the city which makes one feel as though they are not simply in yet another European city.

Moscow had treated us to glorious weather for most of our stay yet it seemed appropriate to leave under steel skies with the heavens open, making it feel more like the old Soviet scenes that must be embedded in the subconscious.

Train number 80 leaves Moscow at 13.05 prompt with little fanfare considering the journey ahead, but this is a regular day in the trains duty of service to the Russian public. There are a handful of locomotives and their rolling stock that traverse over 7,000km of rail network across Russia, this is business as usual for Ninety percent of the people on board. The remainder being made up of a few small groups of Americans, Australians, Germans and English tourists.

Settled in our somewhat spacious new four berth home lain on ribbons of steel we acknowledged that we may not step foot off the train for the next Ninety hours or some Four days further East at Lake Baikal.

Residing in one of carriage Twelve's other compartments were a seemingly closely related group traveling from the estranged Western border of Russia known as Prussia or the Klaningrad region, an annex from the days of the USSR allowing Soviets access to the unfrozen oceans through the Baltic Sea. The party were seafarers in miniature form as they were returning from the World Championship Model Ship Builders competition and slightly inebriated in the afterglow of a Bronze and Silver win. Proudly treating all on board to a showing of their prize winning models, the largest, a fully functioning steam cruiser with over Three years of patience crammed into every detail that had eventually caught the judges eyes.

A lone drunk Armenian gentleman presented the only the slightest trouble in the form of overly friendly conversation and glances that lasted slightly too long to be comfortable.

Alighting a few hours later were a pair of young Russian boxers traveling homeward, they shared our cabin and despite the language barrier we all happily endured 24 hours of each others company. Sharing simple details about our foreign lives though the use of mime, rudumentalal phrase book sentences and a picture book which furthered our conversations tenfold.

As train number 80 continued Eastbound for Irkutsk and Lake Baikal, fellow passengers are regularly abducted during the early hours by stations with unpronounceable names. Occasionally leaving empty compartments like shallow graves but more often easily replaced by fresh faces and new smoking companions.

Well stocked with nuts, tobacco and tea there is little to want for aboard any train yet as the day wears on thoughts turn to a legitimate meal. The scheduled stops are posted neatly in both English and Russian and to the delight of many less prepared passengers our dinner time stop was awash with 'babushkas' the elderly ladies of the local towns who ply their home made goods at the station. While half of the passengers disembark to smoke or stretch out their calfs the rest head for the rickety carts that line the central platform and usually prevail from the scrum with something edible.

The stations themselves gradually shrink like the matryoshka dolls found in the souvenir shops lining Moscow's streets. While some are once grand looking imitations of Moscow central station others are simple concrete shelters with little more than a poorly aging platform and a stop light. Their only real purpose to the long haul passengers is to serve as roll call for the onward march of the trip.

Confusingly trains throughout Russia run to Moscow time making for an interesting adjustment depending how far down the line you are. The country consumes so much of the North Eastern hemisphere that there are officially Six different timezones. Deciding to split the journey in half seemed to be the best option and led to minimal confusion for the duration of the Moscow to Baikal journey.

Although only a geographical location our crossing into Siberia marks the half way point both in time, roughly 48 hours, and distance at a little over 2200km. Disappointingly the only physical milestone slipped away during our second relatively peaceful nights slumber.

The dining carriage, a gloriously open space after the relative confinement of the compartment for nearly 24 hours, felt like a haven for the international travelers. With English the predominant tongue it gave rest bite from the charades and fumbled Russian with the locals. A place for travel tales and route dissection this communal carriage became the sole destination for those seeking an escape from the dormitories.

Tales of an Australian aid worker walking the Saints Way in Cornwall, a remote working judge from Winscontson, filled the air and entertained those who cared to lend an ear. While the the Swedish consulate to Moscow and her friends acted as impromptu translators when gestures and broken English became exhausted.

At this point in time new friends had emerged in different forms the group of young travelers on an organized tour whom were fun for an hour or so at a time but better not to have been in the same carriage as they would rarely rise before midday (when ever that was at the moment) and were clearly taking their tour nickname 'the vodka train' seriously.

Others existed only in a certain space or time, the carriage attendants who seemed to grow increasingly tired of cleaning around their carriage's ungrateful inhabitants. Those who congregate in the disdainful smoking areas between each gateway to the next carriage. The room although supplied with ashtrays lacked any official ventilation and required the main connecting door to be open to avoid any further poisoning, not that the Russians with their frequent visits seemed to care.
