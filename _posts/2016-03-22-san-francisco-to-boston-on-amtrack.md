# San Francisco to Boston on Amtrack

I woke up in Cleveland, this was only distinguishable from the croocked glow of its, surely beloved, football stadium sign. It took a few minutes to recall why I was here at 4 o'clock in the morning. Seven hours eairlier I had witnessed mild déjà Vue as I once again boarded a mile long crosscountry Amtrak train at Chicago's Union Station four months after my initial departure from the same gate, only this time my journey was heading East towards Boston.

There are many ways to cross a continent but in the states most people opt for either plane or car the first for obvious reasons and the second usualy for nesesity or nostalgia. I've had the chance to drive some of the more scenic highways in different states, both route one from SF to LA and what parts of the old 66 that remain are fantastic journeys and I can concour they are exciting to visit but that's all the seem useful for, a visit.

The vast majority of the modern interstates, that have long since bypassed the quaint towns along the way, are little more than arteries feeding numerous larger organs. And that's not a problem unless you actually want to see the country that you are passing through.

Outside of the suburban, container lined sidings that flank the larger city stops Amtrack's network of railroad is usually set to the backdrop of small towns and scenic rural landscapes blended gently with the light movement of each carriage there is a soporific element to this form of transport that the interstates cannot compete with.

I woke again to the sound of an elderly lady playing fruit ninja on her tablet and the sun rising over the plains of OH and over the state line into Pensilvania. I experienced a strange demographic role reversal as I politly enquired if the volume was necessary especially at this early hour but it seemed that it was more of a technical issue on her behalf as she spent considerable time trying to figure out how to atain a more peaceful version of her device.

The landscape has gracefully morphed into a lushus green and plesant land unlike teleporting via plane to the oporsite side of the country train travel lets you absorb the changes aroind you take on a greater significance and enable your brain to better adjust to the body and minds movement through time and space. Jet lag is jetlag for a reason it's the time you need to adjust to overcome time travel no trainlag exists to my knowledge. A few stretches are all that is needed to stave off the effects of prolonged inactivity and anyhow you are much freeer to move around the train for either mental or physical stimulation.

The presence of water becomes much greater the further across Upstate Newyork, wetlands, reserves and the smaller river networks that will eventually feed the NYC water supply. all pass before the trains path as we head for Albany our departing stop for those passengers heading down to Newyork while we push further East.

An extended Lunch in the dining car enables closer screwtenity and discussion about train travel in the US and highlighting what most people regard train travel as is in fact more appropriate to the standard mode of transport here the plane, mainly; expensive, uncomfortable, slow bad service everything the airline industry is yet this is non existent on the rail service. The only benefit of air travel is speed and even that is negligible if you include airport travel and inconvenience as well as jetlag and airport inconvenience the others side.
