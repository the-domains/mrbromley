Within these many silos lies an enormous expanse of energy. The corn and soy crops grown across the plains here, although already harvested leaving endless miles of rough stubble resembling a heartless massacre, will go on to provide countless high fructose products and grain feed for millions in the form of innumerable franken-foods redistributed back amongst the city dwellers who left these areas years ago in search of something greater.</p><p>The end of the line for some and a swift chance to feed a nicotine habit for others but the Zypher rolls onwards through quintessential small town America littered with high school football fields, weatherboard houses with white picket fences. Although the subdued evening light lends an atmosphere remnant of a cold grey Eastern European town the soulful laugh of the coach attendant reminds you that all is well on the way out West.</p><p>The state line, it’s irregular path set by the mighty Mississippi River, brings us to a slow roll as we cross a great iron bridge into Iowa where industry replaces farming and from the comfy leather dining car booth, over an adequately prepared fish dinner, the tracks up towards Ottumwa start to give a sense that we are moving the across the country for the first time. As dusk fades and the majority of travellers begin to either make camp in the coach class or retire to the solitude of their private rooms a sense of calm descends on board. Not the anxious artificial calm onboard an aeroplane but a pleasant genuine relaxation as we settle in for the night, the dull sound of the trains air horn a reminder that progress is being made even as we sleep.</p><p>Somewhere, in the middle of America, Omaha breaks our slumber the shadows of the city warrant less than a twitch of the curtains for the majority of the Zypher’s sleeping cargo. As the early hours pass and after a slightly restless night, breakfast comes early in Denver as the rolling stock is refilled with both fresh fuel and fresh faced travellers. The windows of the observation carriage are maticuosly cleaned in preparation for the panoramic tour de force through the mountains and canyons of Western Colarodo.</p><p>Prepped and rejuvenated the Zypher No. 5 Westbound hauls itself back to life and as the Denver suburbs grow wider and the distant mountains start to make themselves known, the lucky few who scrambled to the viewing carriage in time to get the best seats in the house are already settled down for one of the most scenic train journeys in America.</p><p>The view back across the high plains towards the pigmy Denver skyline is partially obscured by ageing sand filled cargo carriages to protect us from the high winds as we start rounding the first of ‘Big 10′s’ graceful switchbacks. The sun wearily breaks through the morning mist and as we leave civilisation behind a lone ranch in the foothills releases their horses into the sprawling paddock bounding through the gates as if truly wild.</p><p>The extra height we quickly gain brings us through a series of short tunnels and the the lower sections of the mountain where all but a few inches separate the carriages from the rocky outcrops on one side accompanied with vistas looking down on the sparse treelined landscape below. Japanese travellers clamber to get every angle of every shot seemingly of every rock face, possibly forgetting to simply enjoy the ride and admire the beauty in the present.</p><p>A first glimpse of snow lines the shallow rivers that run alongside the tracks as the train gently picks up speed. Small holdings, deserted summer cabins, Aspen pines and icy lakes speckle the valley around us as make our approach to the Moffat tunnel.</p><p>At over Six miles long the Moffat tunnel slices through the mountains from South Boulder Canyon to Winter Park transporting the Zypher and all on board across the geographical divide. While the journey until now held all the trademarks of Fall we escape the darkness of the tunnel and are presented with Winter, snow on the rock faces and icy breath from the few locals already up and about outside.</p><p>The water in the streams below automatically switches flow from East to West as the mountain range above falls into the distance. At over 9,000ft Fraser is one of the the highest towns in America and owes its fortunes to the various ski resorts and winter playgrounds that draw millions to their slopes each Winter. A brief stop to feel the crisp air and freezing temperatures and we begin the gradual decent towards the canyons below.</p><p>As the gorge begins to widen and the first flatlands appear the snow thins out again and subtle hues return to the landscape. The walls begin to rise and the valley this tributary to the Colorado runs through deepens with every slow turn.</p><p>Fraser, Gore and Glenwood canyons strain the eyes and imagination with a constant hi-definition visual display of natural rugged architecture. A densely layered record of millions of years of geologic history revealed at a gentle pace with the overture of tourists and regulars reciting passages from the official Amtrak Zypher’s route guide.</p><p>This stretch of the Rockies, the same path that colossal amounts of coal, wood, steel and household goods in freight wagons as well as hundreds of thousands of people have journeyed, is also home to volcano craters, crystal clear waters and home to rare otters and the national feathery icon, the bald eagle of which we see many soaring above the waters of the Colorado River.</p><p>The confluence of the Fork and Colorado rivers marks the next layover for crew change but soon enough we’re in the foothills of the Rockies home to a micro-climate and Colorado’s wine region. Grand Junction station, the rough half way marker of the journey, arrives all to quickly surrounded by spectacular flat topped mountains and flanked on the west by the largest exposed rock face in the world some 250 miles of geological pornography.</p><p>Rock formations have turned to railway sidings and mutated into the industrial sprawl familiar to these parts we’re heading for the Utah state line somewhere after dark.</p><p>Salt Lake City passes close to midnight and not long after we near our top speed though the Nevada desert. Not that many on board have even turned their clocks backward as mountain time has slipped away in favour of pacific time. Sleep is the main priority for most as the second night of our marathon kicks in.</p><p>Waking to the sight of the first light over the Nevada desert and taking stock of the salt lakes over a bowl of cereal and a fresh cup of tea the Zypher heaves its way through the last few unforgiving miles of desert terrain into Reno for one last crew change before our finale, the Serra Mountains and on towards California.</p><p>The state line is announced by local historians who boarded the train at Reno they continue to provide local information on the area as we climb up through the Serra Nevada mountain range. The climax of their tour is a slow passage high above Lake Tahoe where the winters approach is more visible here at altitude, the snow on the ground is the thickest we’ve seen anywhere on the journey.</p><p>We amble through the thick forests in the lower areas of the range dotted with firs, spruces and the remnants of of mining towns only a few of which remain today. This is the land that pioneers originally came for and the great surge of those who came West would have followed the trail of prosperity until they reached the coast.</p><p>Sacramento, state capital of California brings the journey to a sudden halt with the knowledge that the next stop is our last and the end of the line. We have covered 2,500 miles, a good Two-thirds, of the united States by railroad.</p><p>Arriving into San Francisco slightly ahead of time the last few miles of the journey brings us through the industrial side of the bay area the tracks running right up to the still water flanked in the background with misty shadows outlining the coast on the adjacent side of the estuary, it remind me of somewhere else I’ve spent a lot of time!</p><picture>

<p>It would seem we are not as hardy as we once were, old or young those who choose to travel this way across the states today appear weary after only a few days on the road yet it took a generation to make the west a home and all traveled on foot, by cart or at best on parts of the early railroads that the modern Californian Zephyr takes just 52hours 34minutes to complete.</p></div></section></div><section id="2" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-white colors-local " data-reactid="14"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="15"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="16"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="17"><span data-reactid="18"><!-- react-empty: 19 --><h2 data-reactid="20"><a data-reactid="21">mrbromley</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="22"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="23"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="24"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="25"></div></section></div></div>
