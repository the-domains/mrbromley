It's also one of the few places to get a decent wifi signal and as I finish another run and coke I hit the call on Skype the number takes a few seconds to connect when a screeching on the line disturbs the natural calm that had descended on the dock since the sun slipped away a few hours ago. An instantly recognisable voice finally comes through over some dying digital static, 'where you are?' this slightly commanding yet overtly friendly Spanglish is the first I've heard from Carlos in two days, he reassures me that the choice of restaurant was well made and congratulates me on my arrival to the island, with little small talk we arrange to meet at 3 o'clock the following day.
